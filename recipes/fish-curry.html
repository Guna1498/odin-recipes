    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Indian Fish Curry is a flavorful coastal delicacy made by simmering tender pieces of fish in a spicy, tangy gravy rich with coconut milk, 
       tamarind, and aromatic spices. This dish is enjoyed across India in various regional styles — from Kerala’s coconut-based curry 
       to Goa’s tangy red curry and Bengal’s mustard-infused version.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g firm white fish (such as kingfish, tilapia, or cod), cut into medium pieces</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oil or coconut oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp red chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp coriander powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cumin powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>1 cup coconut milk (optional for coastal style)</li>
        <li>1 small ball of tamarind soaked in water (for tanginess)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander leaves for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean and wash the fish pieces thoroughly. Marinate them with salt, turmeric, and chili powder for 15–20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep pan and sauté chopped onions until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and cook until the raw smell disappears.</li>
        <li>Stir in chopped tomatoes and cook until soft and the oil separates.</li>
        <li>Add turmeric, chili powder, coriander, cumin, and garam masala. Mix well and cook for 2–3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in tamarind water (or a few drops of lemon juice) and a little water to make the curry base.</li>
        <li>Add coconut milk if desired and bring to a gentle simmer.</li>
        <li>Carefully add the marinated fish pieces. Cover and cook on low flame for 10–12 minutes until the fish is tender and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Adjust seasoning and garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with steamed rice or chapati.</li>
    </ol>
